# Traffic Simulation Script (Python + aiohttp)

This Python script is designed for **ethical website traffic simulation**. It's primarily intended for:

- Website load testing  
- Performance analysis  
- Analytics and tracking setup validation  

> ⚠️ **This tool must only be used on websites you own or have explicit permission to test. Misuse may result in legal consequences.**

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Asynchronous HTTP requests for speed (using `aiohttp`)
- ✅ Unique user-agent and IP simulation with [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)
- ✅ Custom number of visits
- ✅ Retry mechanism for failed requests
- ✅ Optional randomized delay for natural traffic simulation

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install aiohttp faker

🛠️ How to Use
Run the script using:
python traffic_simulator.py

You'll be prompted to enter:

✅ Target website URL (must include http:// or https://)

✅ Number of simulated visits

🧠 How It Works
Generates unique HTTP headers for each request

Sends concurrent requests using asyncio + aiohttp

Retries up to 3 times per visit if a request fails

Adds small randomized delays between requests to avoid flooding

🔒 Disclaimer
This script is intended for ethical use only. Examples of valid use:

Load testing your own website

Analytics tag firing validation

Stress testing new server setups

Education or learning purposes on localhost

❌ Do not use this for:

DDoS attacks

Inflating ad revenue or SEO metrics
